  ***Introduction:-***
   - Robot Framework is a test automation framework that makes it easy for QA teams to manage acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).
   - It has simple plain text syntax and it can be extended easily with libraries implemented using Python or Java.
  
   - See ```https://robotframework.org/``` for Robot Framework home page

**Who is this repository for?**
 - This repository is for newbies to Robot Framework interested in automating the mobile UI.

## 1. What exactly in it?
 * Introduces the basic Robot Framework syntax, how tests are executed, and how logs and reports look like
 * Framework Architecture:
    We have two below libraries:-
     - 1. Robot Standard Libraries: These test libraries are distributed with Robot Framework
     - 2. Robot Referenced Libraries : These are external Libraries installed by pip.
 * Folders
   - a) External keywords : This section is used to set up the common functions which will be used throughout the framework like locators,swipe  etc.
   - b) Resources: This section is used to set up all the global level parameters which will be used throughout the framework like libraray etc.
   - c) Test cases: This section is where all the tests are automated.
     * Package is created with name RegressionSuite and all the tests are automated in it.
     * For Ex: Under Test cases directory we have sub directory called RegressionSuite.
     * and under RegressionSuite we have tests Mobile UI with the following tests are mentioned below
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87467505/156704646-376e46d6-b993-43ed-8266-22eb0f2f45b1.png)
  - d) TestData: This section will contain stored test data in form of json or excel which will be used by our test.
  - f) Json files: This section contains json file which contains all locators in the form of keyvalue pair.
    * For Ex. Elements.json
  - g) Report: This section contains report.html and log.html file stored in it.
  - h) Snapshots: This section contains all the screenshots which are taken on testcases pass and fail condition.
    
## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iY8CRBdQXODJSCERIr/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Usage
    
 - When using Robot Framework, it is generally recommended to write as easy-to-understand tests as possible.
 - This is illustrated by the following sample example
 - _Setting section_ contains all the required libraries that are required by the test
```
*** Settings ***
Library        AppiumLibrary
Resource       ../../Resources/Library.robot
```
 - Variables are used to hold a value, which can be used in test cases
```
*** Variables ***
${URL}  http://172.16.52.125:4723/wd/hub
```
    
```
*** Test Cases ***
[Documentation]  Test Cases for Login module
TC\_001- Application start and close						//Testcase name
[Tags]  Regression								//User defined tagging for the particular testcase.
Given user\_open\_application    						//User defined global keyword maintained in library.robot file
${username\_text} =    Read\_Element\_Locator  Login.username\_textbox\_xpath		//User defined keyword to fetch the keyvalue through the jsonpath
${paswword\_text} =    Read\_Element\_Locator  Login.password\_textbox\_xpath		//User defined keyword to fetch the keyvalue through the jsonpath
${send\_button} =      Read\_Element\_Locator  Login.login\_button\_id			//User defined keyword to fetch the keyvalue through the jsonpath
${account\_section} =  Read\_Element\_Locator  Login.account\_button\_xpath		//User defined keyword to fetch the keyvalue through the jsonpath
${logout} =           Read\_Element\_Locator  Login.logout\_xpath			//User defined keyword to fetch the keyvalue through the jsonpath

When click element  id=${send\_button}					//Clicking on the send button
when wait until page contains element  xpath=${account\_section}  20		//Using waits
When capture page screenshot  D:/pycharm/PyCharm Community Edition 2019.3.4/robotautomation/snapshot/TC\_001.png 		//Capturing the screenshot
When Click Element  xpath=${account\_section}				//Click on the account section
When Click Element  xpath=${logout}					//Clicking on the logout button
Then user\_close\_application							//User defined global keyword maintained in library.robot file
```



- Running tests:
 - Tests are executed from the command line using the robot command
```
    robot <Foldername>/<TestName>.robot
```
For Ex: 
```
    robot TC_001- Application start and close.robot
```
- Generated results:
 - After running tests you will get report and log in HTML format.
   - 1. ```report.html```
   - 2. ```log.html```
